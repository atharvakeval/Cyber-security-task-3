# Cyber-security-task-3
Task: Perform a Basic Vulnerability Scan on Your PC

What I Did:
For this task, I used Nessus Essentials to scan my local machine for vulnerabilities. I downloaded it from the official website, set my local IP as the target, and ran a full system scan.

Once the scan completed, I reviewed the report. It highlighted several issues, including software vulnerabilities and outdated services. I noted the most critical ones and researched some fixes and mitigations.

Tool Used:
- Nessus Essentials (Free Edition)

What I Learned:
- How vulnerability scanners detect weak points in a system
- What CVSS means and how severity is scored
- Why keeping software and OS up to date is important
- How vulnerability scanning differs from penetration testing
